COMPLETE: WHEN THE REST IS WRITTEN
\\

This bachelor's thesis consists on a software that implements an in-hand object learning and recognition using 2D and 3D information. 
\\

The code is Open-Source and it was designed to be running inside a robot. The idea is to create a new stand-alone module that could be included in every robot using ROS and a kinect or other RGB-D sensor. This way, having different modularized functionalities it could be possible to create a customized robot in a few seconds, just importing packages and compiling them.
