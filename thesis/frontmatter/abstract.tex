\chapter{Abstract}
This bachelor's thesis consists on a software that implements an in-hand object learning and recognition using 2D and 3D information. 
The code is Open-Source and it was designed to be running inside a robot. 
The idea is to create a new stand-alone module that could be included in different robots. 
This package would aid in the environment perception of the robot. 
\\

The thesis is structured as follows. 
First, the purpose and motivations are presented and a brief description of the project is performed. 
Afterwards, the state of the art is explained and the innovations performed in this thesis with respect to the previous art are highlighted. 
Then, the system developed is described as well as the experiments performed on it. 
Finally, the results are shown and discussed and the conclusions derived from them explained.
This project is aimed as a proof of concept study and hence the possible improvements observed from the experiments are also presented in the last section. 
\\

The analysis of the system demonstrated an increase of the accuracy with the increment of views per object acquired.
The results depicted the robustness of the system as well, since it is able to differentiate between similar objects a high number of times
