I would like to thank my boyfriend Alvaro for his support and comprehension during the whole project and for his help and patience in the difficult moments. 
\\

I wish to acknowledge my parents as well. They have always supported and encouraged me. They teached me the importance of learning and also the importance of always giving the best possible version of oneself.
\\

I also would like to thank the teachers I had during my life. Those who were better for helping me to easily acquire the knowledge of their subjects, and those who were worse for aiding me in learning how to overcome difficulties and be self-sufficient. 
\\


I am particularly grateful for the assistance given by my thesis supervisor, Víctor González Pacheco, for teaching me how to make rigorous documentation and how to organize a project correctly. Also, for giving me some key pointers without which this project would not have been possible. 
\\
  
And finally, I would like to thank my friends and family, specially Rocío and Blanca for being always there.
