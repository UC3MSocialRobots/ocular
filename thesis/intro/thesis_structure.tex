\section{Thesis structure}

The thesis begins with a perspective of the related art on the field and the different technologies that are commonly used in computer vision. This comparison of the previous work and the one proposed in the thesis can be found in section \ref{state_of_the_art}. 
\\

Afterwards, the proposed solution is described and explained. The different parts are individually presented and the whole functioning of the software thoroughly explained. The alternatives to the proposed model are shown in section \ref{system_design} as well as the reasons behind the election of the system that is presented in this thesis. 
\\

The experiments carried out to validate the system are presented in the section \ref{methods}. Section \ref{results} is devoted to the analytical explanation of those experiment's results. 
These results are compared and analyzed in the following one, section \ref{discussion}. 
\\

Finally, the conclusions extracted from those experiments and the possible future lines of work are exposed in the last part of the project.
