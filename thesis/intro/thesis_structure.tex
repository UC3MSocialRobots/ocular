\section{Thesis structure}

The thesis begins with a perspective of the related work on the field that was previously developed and the different technologies that are commonly used in computer vision. This comparison of the previous work and the one proposed in the thesis can be found in the \ref{state_of_the_art} section. 
\\

Afterwards, the proposed solution is described and explained. The different parts of it are individually presented and the whole functioning of the software thoroughly explained. The alternatives to the proposed model are shown as well as the reasons behind the election of the system that is presented in this thesis. 
\\

The experiments made in the system are presented in the section \ref{methods}. The following one is devoted to the analytical explanation of those experiment's results. 
The results are compared and analyzed in the following one, section number \ref{discussion}. 
\\

Finally, the conclusions extracted from those experiments and the possible future lines of work are exposed in the last part of the project.
