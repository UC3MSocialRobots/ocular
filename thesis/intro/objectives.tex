\section{Objectives}

The main objective of this thesis is the development of an object learning and recognition software using 2D and 3D information. 
In order to achieve those objectives, an spiral software development model was applied. In this model, the software analysis, objectives definitions, prototypes creation and testing are done iteratively. 
\\

The intermediate objectives of the thesis that were defined in each iteration are enumerated below. 

\begin{itemize}

	\item{Develop or adapt an existing hand tracking software}
	\item{Develop a Region Of Interest extractor software in order to filter the input raw 2D information. }
	\item{Develop a Region Of Interest extractor software in order to filter the input raw 3D information. }
	\item{Develop an object learning software using 2D data that allows to extract multiple views from each object}
	\item{Develop an object learning software using 3D data that allows to extract multiple views from each object}
	\item{Develop an object recognition software using 2D data and multiple object's views}
	\item{Develop an object recognition software using 3D data and multiple object's views}
	\item{Develop a feedback system to reduce the recognition uncertainties}
	\item{Develop a gesture interface to control the software}
	\item{Compare the object recognition using 2D and 3D information, the effectiveness and efficiency of each algorithm}
	\item{Perform a comparative study when changing the number of views used per object}

\end{itemize}
