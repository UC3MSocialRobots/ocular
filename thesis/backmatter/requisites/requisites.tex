\subsection{Introduction}
\hspace{0.5cm}The project consists in an in-hand object learning and recognition software. 
The project is conceived for being used in a robot. In a robot there are numerous processes that have to run in parallel to avoid a lose of information and be able to work and respond in real time. 
\\
To fulfill this request, the code has been subdivided in nodes that perfom simple tasks and that are executed simultaneously. 
\\
The nodes that appear in the project are the following : 

%include the new picture!!
\begin{itemize}
\item Converter : \\
There exists a converter node that transforms the pi\_ tracker message into the custom message HandLoc. This transformation is made extracting only the information regarding the hands and their name and copying it into the correct fields of the new message. 
This message is the one being used in the rest of the project's code. Hence, this node is the one that connects the thesis ROS package with the pi\_ tracker package.

\item ROI Segmenters:\\ 
These nodes work using the previous node's information. They extract the Region Of Interest (ROI) from the raw input information. Since the information that the project can analyze is both in 2D and 3D, there will be two ROI Segmenters, one for each type of information. 
Those two ROI Segmenter nodes run in parallel but they depend in each other. The actual segmentation is made with the 3D data. The result is two new point clouds with the hands.
After the 3D segmentation, the maximum and minimum coordinates of each of the hands' point clouds are transformed to pixels in order to segment the 2D ROI. 

\item Feature Extractors: \\
As the ROI Segmenters, there will be two nodes to extract the features. One extracts the 3D features from the segmented point cloud and the other one extracts the 2D features from the segmented picture. 
The features are characteristics of interest of the objects whose value can be used to discriminate between objects and hence distinguish some objects within a set of different data. 


\item Learner: \\
This node implements the learning sequence of new objects and also the training of the algorithm specified in the functional requirements section. 
It uses the features (both 2D and 3D) extracted from the previous node to make the training. 

\item Recogniser:\\ 
This node implements the recognizing sequence. It compares the features extracted at each captured frame using the previously trained algorithms. 
\end{itemize}
   
The communication between nodes is made using the Robotic Operating System topics. The nodes can publish in a specific topic a certain message or subscribe to that topic to retrieve the message. 
There are different types of messages depending on the information that has to be transmitted. There exist certain ROS libraries that define standard messages or geometric messages as an example. It is also possible to create a custom message type. 


\subsection{Nodes}

\subsubsection{Converter Node}

This node converts the messages from other ROS packages to the internal message format used within the code. 
Figure \ref{uc_converter} presents the use case diagram of the node. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/diagrams/uc_converter.eps}
			\caption[Use case diagram converter node]{Use Case diagram of the converter node}
		\label{uc_converter}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
	
\subsubsection{ROI Segmenter Nodes}
There are two nodes that extract the ROI (Region Of Interest), one for the 2D and the other one for the 3D data.

\paragraph {ROI Segmenter 3D Node\\[0.5cm]}

The first region of interest segmented is the 3D. Using the hand's center position obtained from the pi\_ tracker ROS package a prism is extracted around it. Its dimensions are all fixed to an experimental value that is suitable for this purpose. 
No outlier filtering is done due to the high computing time required.  
The limits of the 3D ROI extracted are converted to pixels and published in a topic. These limits are the inputs of the following node. 
Figure \ref{uc_roi3d} shows the use case diagram of the node. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/diagrams/uc_roi_segmenter_3d.eps}
			\caption[Use case diagram ROI segmenter 3D node]{Use Case diagram of the ROI segmenter 3D node}
		\label{uc_roi3d}	

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{ROI Segmenter 2D Node\\[0.5cm]}
As it was previously mentioned, the 2D ROI dimensions are extracted from the 3D ROI. The original image obtained from the RGB-D sensor is cropped using those points. 
The outputs of this node are two topics, one with the 2D ROI (a custom message that includes an image and a name) and the other one with the 3D ROI (a point cloud).
To decrease the computation time, the point clouds do not have the RGB component. Thus, the color information is obtained through the 2D ROI. 
Figure \ref{uc_roi2d} presents the use case of this node. 
\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/diagrams/uc_roi_segmenter_2d.eps}
			\caption[Use case diagram ROI segmenter 2D node]{Use Case diagram of the ROI segmenter 2D node}
		\label{uc_roi2d}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Feature Extractor Nodes}
\paragraph{Feature Extractor 2D Node \\[0.5cm]}
This node is used to extract the descriptors or features from the 2D Region Of Interest. 
The use case diagram may be found in figure \ref{uc_fe2d}

			\caption[Use case diagram Feature Extractor 2D node]{Use Case diagram of the Feature Extractor 2D node}
		\label{uc_fe2d}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Feature Extractor 3D Node \\[0.5cm]}
Similarly to the feature extractor 2D node, this node extracts the descriptors from the 3D ROI. 
Its use case diagram is shown in figure \ref{uc_fe3d}.

\end{figure}


% \paragraph{Data Parser Node}
% This node stores the 2D and 3D features of each template of the same object in one file. 
% \begin{figure}[H]
% \begin{center}
% 	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/diagrams/uc_data_parser.eps}
% \end{center}
% \end{figure}


\subsubsection{Event Handler Node}
	This node identifies the different user's gestures and publishes the current event.
	Its use case diagram may be found in figure \ref{uc_event}. 

	\begin{figure}[H]

		\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/diagrams/uc_event_handler.eps}

	\caption[Use case diagram Event Handler node]{Use Case diagram of the Event Handler node}
		\label{uc_event}
\end{figure}
	
	
\subsubsection{Learner Recognizer Node}

\hspace{0.5cm}This node implements the state machine algorithm. It has two differentiated modes: learning and recognizing. 

\begin{itemize}

\item{Learning\\}

This mode learns 2D and 3D features extracted from the handheld object using a RGB-D sensor.   
The sequence of the object learning is the following:
\\
First, 3D and 2D descriptors are extracted and written to a file. Then, two algorithms are trained (one for 2D and the other for the 3D template). The parameters of each trained algorithm are stored in a file. There will be hence one file per learned object and one file per algorithm.
\\

The learning of the objects is done in-hand. The training starts when the user extends the hand in front of the body, showing the new object to the RGB-D sensor. Then, the user rotates the object to allow the software to extract the features of different views to obtain a more robust model of the object. This way of learning new objects will allow a more intuitive interaction human-robot. When the user returns the arm to a position which is closer to the body, the algorithm starts learning the new object and after the learning, it comes back to the recognizing mode, which is the default. 


\item{Recognizing\\}

This mode tracks the user's hands and recognizes the held objects. 

There are two different algorithms, one trained with the 2D data and the other one trained with the 3D data. More information about those algorithms may be found in the Functional Requirements section. 
\\
The steps done by this mode are the following: 
First, as in the Learning Mode, 2D and 3D descriptors are extracted. Then, the algorithms will compare that information with the learned one. 
The output of each algorithm will be a percentage of similarity between the dataset and the new object. 
The 3D information is more reliable than the 2D. The latter is subjected to inaccuracies due to illumination or view angle that affects the descriptors extracted and hence the object recognition.
Due to this fact, weights for the output of each algorithm will be given. Those give a higher importance to the 3D descriptors since they are more robust. 
\\
The object that is finally published in a topic will be the one with a higher percentage of similarity.

% \end{figure}


\subsection{Third Party Packages}
\hspace{0.5cm}In this project, three third party libraries are being used: pi\_ tracker, OpenCV, PCL. 
\subsubsection{ Pi\_ tracker}
Pi\_ tracker is a ROS package that publishes the position and orientation of each joint of the users. From that information, the location of both hands of the user is extracted and used in the rest of the software. 
\subsubsection{ OpenCV}
This real-time computer vision library is used mainly to extract and compare the features of the objects in 2D. 
\subsubsection{PCL}
This open-source framework implements different algorithms for n-dimensional point clouds and 3D geometry processing.
In this project, it is used to filter, extract features and segment the RGB-D's point clouds.

\subsection{Node Interaction}
In the following diagram it can be seen the interaction and the information exchanged between nodes.

% \end{figure}

\subsection{Sequence Diagram}
In the following diagram can be seen the interaction between nodes. \\
The Event Handler node triggers the execution of the Recognizer and the Learner nodes. As it was previously mentioned, the triggering event is defined to create a more natural human-machine interaction.
The converter, ROI Segmenters and Feature Extractors nodes are continuously working and publishing the information on their topics. 
Hence, the information needed for the Event Handler, Recognizer and Learner nodes is obtained subscribing to those topics.
