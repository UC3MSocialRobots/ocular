	\chapter{Project management}
		 The present section describes the project management followed in this thesis. The Gantt diagram created for this purpose can be seen in the following page.
		 \\

		 The thesis was started on February 7th 2013 and was finished on ??.  
		 The project management has suffered modifications throughout its development.  The final project management chart has three differentiated parts the learning phase, the project programming and the documentation phase. 
		 \begin{itemize}
			 	\item{\textbf{Learning phase}} \\
			 	This part consisted on a exploration of all the different technologies that could be used and the different state of the art techniques available. A thorough research on the object recognition and human tracking fields was performed. This research continued until the finishing of the thesis, but the most important part of it was made in this period of time. 
			 	\\

			 	The methods found were tested through demonstrations and there the main problems and possible solutions were obtained. This phase was crucial for the project, since in it the requisites of the software were defined as well as the technologies used and the general skeleton of the project's design that would later be implemented. 
			 	\\

			 	\item{\textbf{Project programming}}\\
			 	In this phase the project was coded and tested. The state of the art algorithms research continued to allow the overcoming of the different difficulties that appear when implementing theoretical concepts. This modified the project's design as well as some of the technologies applied in the thesis. 

			 	\item{\textbf{Documentation}}\\
			 	This final part of the project consisted on creating the documentation of the project and the present thesis. Also, the presentation documentation was prepared.
