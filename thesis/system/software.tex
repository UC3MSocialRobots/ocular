In this section the software developed in this Bachelor's Thesis is presented and thoroughly explained. 
\\

The code was created as a ROS package. ROS (Robotic Operating System) is an Operating System designed to be implemented in robots. It has libraries to enhance the communication between nodes, the processes management or the threads present in the code among other functionalities. 
Since this code is intended to be running on a robot, the software developed was created as a ROS package. 
\\

In order to manage 2D and 3D information (images and pointclouds) two libraries has been used: OpenCV, and PCL. Those two libraries implement basic and state-of-the-art algorithms that allow a easier and more time-efficient management of the data. Further information about these libraries might be found on the sections \ref{opencv} and \ref{pcl} respectively. 
\\

The software was structured in nodes. These nodes have a relatively small functionality and run in parallel. The fact that they run simultaneously improves the efficiency of the code lowering the lag due to time-expensive operations. 
\\

In the following sections, the software structure and tools used are described.
