\section{Introduction}

This chapter presents the description of the system created for this Bachelor's Thesis. The solution proposed implements a software capable of tracking the user's hands and learning and recognizing the objects that are hand-held. 
\\
The system has two main parts: the software and the hardware. 
The hardware needed for the software to work correctly is an RGB-D sensor. In the following section the different data acquisition devices are explained and why it was decided to use an RGB-D sensor as the input of the system.
