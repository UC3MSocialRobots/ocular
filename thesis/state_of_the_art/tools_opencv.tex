%Intro
OpenCV\cite{opencv} (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library that implements state of the art real-time computer vision 
algorithms. 

It is cross-platform and it is released under a BSD\cite{BSD} license. Previously it was integrated in ROS \cite{ros}, but
now it is used as a stand-alone library.

The qualities described above as well as its optimization of various algorithms make this library an extremely useful asset for robotic vision projects. 

% In this project's context

In this project the C++ interface of the OpenCV library has been used. The functionalities provided by this library are used in all the 2D information management. The next paragraph details the operations for which this library has been used.
