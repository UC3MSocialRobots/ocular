\section{PCL}
\label{pcl}
PCL (Point Cloud Library) is a standalone library that is open source and implements state-of-the-art algorithms related to 2D and 3D image and point cloud processing. \\

It is released under a BSD license, being free for commercial and research use. Is cross-platform and currently has been successfully compiled on Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android and iOS. \\

The library is divided in smaller code libraries that can be compiled separately. This modularity allows the PCL introduction on platforms with size constrains or that has a reduce computational size. \cite{Rusu_ICRA2011_PCL}

\subsection{Point Cloud}
A point cloud is a data structure that represents a set of multi-dimensional points that is used to represent three-dimensional data. There are two types of point clouds: 3D point cloud in which the points represent the x, y and z coordinates and that has no color information and 4D point cloud in which the color information is included. 
\\

Point clouds are acquired from hardware sensors such as RGB-D sensors, 3D scanners or time-of-flight cameras. Also, those data structures might be generated synthetically. PCL can process data from devices such as the PrimeSensor 3D cameras, the Microsoft Kinect or the Ausus XTionPRO.
