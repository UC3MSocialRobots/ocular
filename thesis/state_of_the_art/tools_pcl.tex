\subsection{Point Cloud}
A point cloud is a data structure that represents a set of multi-dimensional points that is used to represent three-dimensional data. There are two types of point clouds: 3D point cloud in which the points represent the x, y and z coordinates and that has no color information and 4D point cloud in which the color information is included. 
\\

Point clouds are acquired from hardware sensors such as RGB-D sensors, 3D scanners or time-of-flight cameras. Also, those data structures might be generated synthetically. PCL can process data from devices such as the PrimeSensor 3D cameras, the Microsoft Kinect or the Ausus XTionPRO.
