\section{Accuracy measurement}
\label{results_accuracy_measurement}
This sections presents the results obtained in the accuracy measurement experiment. 
It was previously explained that the different objects may be learned using one or more views per template. 
The accuracy is analyzed depending on the number of views learned. 
One, five and ten views were used and the same experiment was performed in each of them. 
The data in the confusion matrices shown below is normalized to range [0,1].
This is due to the fact that the publishing rate of the topics varies with the amount of templates. 
Hence, for an experiment that lasts the same amount of time a larger number of messages would appear when the algorithm has 1 view templates. 
The discussion of the results can be found in section \ref{discussion}.

\subsection{Template using 1 view}
This experiment was performed adding to the dataset one view per object. 
Figure \ref{1view_matrix} shows the confusion matrix obtained with the experiment. 

The F1-score obtained per object as well as their precision and recall values may be found in figure \ref{1view_fscore}.

\subsection{Template using 5 views}
In this experiment, five views were retrieved per object. 
The confusion matrix may be seen in figure \ref{5views_matrix}. 
Figure \ref{5views_fscore} shows the F1-score obtained in this measurement, as well as the precision and recall per object.

\subsection{Template using 10 views}
The last experiment was performed introducing ten views per object in the dataset. 
Figure \ref{10views_matrix} represents the confusion matrix obtained. 
The F1-score and the precision and recall per object may be found in figure \ref{10views_fscore}.

	\subsection{Comparison of the experiments results using different number of views}
	In this subsection the results presented in this section are summarized and presented together. 
	This is performed to offer a more global view of the system's performance as a function of the number of templates being used.
