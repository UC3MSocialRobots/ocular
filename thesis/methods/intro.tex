%\section{Introduction}

In the present part of the Bachelor's thesis the conditions in which the software was tested and the elements present in that testing are explained. The elements are the computer and the RGB-D sensor being used. \\[0.5cm]

The software has been built in a modular way that allows an easy location of the problems and bottle necks.
Different aspects of the code are tested and benchmarked such as the CPU and RAM consumption of the whole code. Also, since the processing has been distributed over the different nodes, the test describes the response of each one separately. 
The nodes are also benchmarked accordingly showing the publishing rate and the used bandwidth.

Apart from the performance of the code, a study of the algorithm's correctness is performed. This study is created to determine the number of true and false positives and negatives. Using that data, in the following chapter the F-score of the software is calculated and the confusion matrix constructed. \\[0.5cm]
