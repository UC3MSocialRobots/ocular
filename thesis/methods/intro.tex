\chapter{Introduction}

In the present part of the Bachelor's thesis the tests conditions in which the software was tried are explained. Also, the different items present in the testing are presented. \\

The software has been built in a modular way that allows an easy location of the problems and bottle necks.
In the tests performed different aspects of the code are tested and benchmarked such as the CPU and RAM consumption of the whole code. Also, since the processing has been distributed over the different nodes, the test describes the response of each one separately. 
The nodes are also benchmarked accordingly showing the publishing rate and the used bandwidth. 
Apart from the performance of the code, a study of the algorithm's correctness is performed.

\\

In the following sections the different tests performed on the software are explained, as well as the hardware used in those tests. 
\\

In the next parts, the solutions of the tests are presented and discussed.
