%Points discussed
\section{\LARGE Points discussed: }
	\subsection{First Demo Presentation}
	
		\begin{myindentpar}{1cm} 
			During the meeting, the first provisional demo was presented. The code was discussed as well as the possibility of changing the language programming from Python to C++ due to the lack of information of the OpenCV python bindings. 
		\end{myindentpar}
		
	\subsection{Profiling}
		\begin{myindentpar}{1cm}
			It was discussed the possibility of using profiling as a tool to enhance the performance of the Demo code. Profiling would highlight the functions in the code that waste more time and hence easy the detection of the parts needing improvement. 
		\end{myindentpar}
		
	\subsection{Bachlor's Thesis Repository}
		\begin{myindentpar}{1cm}
			It was commented that the code developed to learn and the demo code was available in a GitHub repository, whose link is the following: \emph{
			https://github.com/irenesanznieto/TFG}.
		\end{myindentpar}
		
	\subsection{Presentations}
		\begin{myindentpar}{1cm} 
			It was discussed the necessity of improving the presentation of the code. This improvement includes more documentation (such as graphs or flowcharts) which can help in the explanation of the work done and a better understanding of the algorithms being used. 
		\end{myindentpar}
		




%Decisions made	
\section{\LARGE Decisions made:}
	\subsection{First Demo Optimization}
		\begin{myindentpar}{1cm} 
			It was decided to optimize the first demo to enhance the processing time. This optimized version will be presented in the next meeting. 
		\end{myindentpar}
