\chapter*{Hardware}

Computer vision is a field that needs specific hardware to retreive a description of the world. This description has been done for a number of years in two dimensions. But this changed when the first version of an affordable RGB-D sensor appeared in 2010: the Kinect.
\\

This sensor was designed to be used in games, but developers soon realized the huge potential of the hardware for Computer Vision.  
Now, instead of a two-dimensional information as an input to the various softwares it was possible to have three-dimensional information. 
\\

Two-dimensional information is a projection of a three-dimensional world and so there appear ambiguities when using that data. That is why having three-dimensional information is a big advantage.
