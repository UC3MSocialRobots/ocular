\subsection*{SIFT}

%The SIFT descriptor still seems to be the most appealing descriptor for practical uses, and hence also the most widely used nowadays. It is distinctive and relatively fast, which is crucial for on-line applications. Recently, Se et al. [22] implemented SIFT on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and improved its speed by an order of magnitude. However, the high dimensionality of the de- scriptor is a drawback of SIFT at the matching step. For on-line applications on a regular PC, each one of the three steps (detection, description, matching) should be faster still. Lowe
